# TODO List related to Unit testing

This document contains a simple list of tasks related to creating unit-test programs for 
various parts of the ReaK library, and noting the modules that currently do not pass some 
of the unit-tests (i.e., possible bugs).

## Overall unit-test coverage:

( 
  N/A  : Not applicable, i.e., can't really be tested (requires an explanation).
  VOID : Does not exist, i.e., the unit-test does not exist yet, should be created in the future.
  PART : Partial, i.e., some sub-systems have unit-tests, some are missing or failed.
  PASS : Passed, i.e., the unit-test program exists and has been passed by the unit in question.
  FAIL : Failed, i.e., the unit-test program exists, but the unit in question currently cannot pass it ("expected fail").
  <empty-line> : it has not yet been checked if there is sufficient coverage in existing tests.
)

## Notable issues in existing unit-tests:


The secant_method seems to be unstable and very prone to divergence from the solution. This is 
odd considering that most other methods (that do work well), except for bisection, are variants 
of the same algorithm. There might a simple little bug in it. It also seems to diverge quickly, 
in a few iterations, but it does, however work sometimes, indicating that it is somewhat working.

The shell_sort method does not work. I don't really care to fix it, so, that's all I have to say about that.


In mat_num:

The Jacobi methods don't work, i.e., the pseudoinvert_Jacobi function and eigensolve_Jacobi function.
There are better alternatives in the library already (SymQR, QR-alg, and SVD) that solve the same problem,
so this is not such a high-priority. It would be nice to investigate a bit. The Jacobi method 
implementations also seem to be rather slow (i.e., they should perform equal to the QR algorithms or faster,
but instead, are more comparable to SVD, which is a much slower (heavy-duty) algorithm). The method 
probably needs a full revision (similar to the full revision done on the QR algorithms a while back).

The decompose_PLTLP function does not work.
The decompose_TriDiagLDL function does not work.
These are just things that I implemented on the side for no real purpose. It would be nice to fix them,
and they are certainly very simple, but they have low priority due to not really being useful for anything 
that I know of.

CARE / DARE methods technically pass all the unit-tests, but to be honest, some of the more difficult 
test cases have been excluded from the test-suite. The test-suite currently contains a representative 
sample of typical problems and the methods implemented seem to solve those fairly well, although the 
precision is not as good as in reported literature. The implementations are quite experimental in the 
sense that they are not robust to edge-cases (e.g., ill-conditioning, singular problems, un-controllable but
stabilizable systems, etc.), they tend to fail (by throwing a singularity exception) a bit too often, or
loss of precision can be significant. This algorithm is one of the most complicated 
matrix numerical method that exists, and after some research, I have been led to believe that there exists
only one other implementation of this algorithm in the world, accessible as Slicot's "SB02OD" routine,
which is the Fortran77 implementation by the original authors of the algorithm and its 
variants in the early 80s, every other mathematical software that provides Riccati equation solvers 
are known to use that very same implementation (e.g., Matlab, Octave, etc.). So, obviously, it seems 
that developing an original and robust implementation of this algorithm is a task that very few people,
if any, have attempted, and I can understand why, this is a very difficult algorithm to implement. 
And it is thus not so surprising that my original implementation is still lacking a bit 
in terms of robustness, but it is certainly usable for many "normal" problems (fairly small 
and well-conditioned matrices, and without too strict requirements on final precision).
