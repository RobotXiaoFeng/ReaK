This folder is the trunk of all the source files in this project.

The following files are included:

 - ./clean_temporaries.sh: is a simple script to remove (rm) all the temporary files with trailing ~ sign.

 - CMakeLists.txt: is the root cmake file that sets up a few custom build commands and starts the inclusion of the subfolders in the build process.

 - sloc_output.txt: is the report generated by the free software "sloccount" about the number of lines of code for the ReaK source files.

 - src.kdev4: is the project file generated by KDevelop 4, which was used in the development of this project. Note that this file does not participate to the build process but only uses the CMakeLists.txt files to resolve inclusion paths (for code-completion and highlighting).


The following subfolders are included:

 - ReaK: is the top-level folder for all the source files of the ReaK platform.

 - build: the folder used for the cmake process (out-of-source build) (details follow).


BUILD PROCEDURE:
To build the entire source file tree, follow the following simple process:

Starting from this folder, if build is not present, do:
$Â mkdir build

Go to the build folder with:
$ cd build

Execute cmake on the upper-level folder (this folder):
$ cmake ../
  Alternate: for a specific Release or Debug build, use the following:
  $ cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release [or Debug]

Now the project can be compiled with:
$ make
  To clean, run:
  $ make clean
  To make a specific target and its dependencies, only, run:
  $ make [target, e.g. wopa_test_ctrl_sim]

Finally, to install a complete release build:
$ make install [--prefix=/my/path/to/install/]
